# Magma v1.3.1

## Please note: release 1.3.1 has been deprecated.  We recommend all new installs start with release 1.3.2.  All running instances of 1.3.1 are encouraged to upgrade to release 1.3.2.

We are pleased to announce the v1.3.1 hotfix release for Magma.  This release contains support for unmanaged eNodeB as well as fixes for a few known issues. See the [release page](https://github.com/magma/magma/releases/tag/v1.3.1) for more information and release notes.

It is recommended that users of release 1.3.0 implement this upgrade.
