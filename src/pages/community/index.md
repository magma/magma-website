Testing #2, DO NOT MERGE

Magma is an open-source software platform that gives network operators an open, flexible and extendable mobile core network solution. Our ethos is user-driven and our culture is welcoming and respectful. We invite you to try out Magma, provide your feedback and get involved in contributing to the code.

## <div id="governance"></div> Governance

Magma strives to operate under an open governance model that encourages contribution and participation from all interested organizations and developers. Technical decisions are made by technical contributors and a representative Technical Steering Committee, as detailed in the project [Technical Charter](https://github.com/magma/tsc/blob/main/CHARTER.md). The community is committed to diversity, openness, and encouraging new contributors and leaders to rise up.

### Development Roles

#### Contributors

Anyone can become a Contributor by submitting code to the project and having that code accepted through the projectâ€™s review process. A Contributor is someone who has had code merged within the last 12 months. Contributors have access to propose and review code but not merge the code into repos of the project.

#### Committers

A Committer has the ability to merge code into the project. Committers are active Contributors and participants in the project. In order to become a Committer, you must be nominated and approved by the established Committers. Within the project, sub-components may decide to have additional requirements for the review of code in their repos.

#### Code review process

All pull requests require 2 approvals from committers for commits as a starting point. Sub groups can evolve this based on what works.

#### Committer nominations

Committers must be nominated and approved by established committers through a simple majority with no existing committer objecting.

### Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is comprised of 5 members who are responsible for architectural decisions and making final decisions if the Committers cannot come to an agreement. The TSC will will develop and approve additional governance rules and proceudres for the project, as detailed in the [Technical Charter](https://github.com/magma/tsc/blob/main/CHARTER.md).

The exact size and model for the TSC may evolve over time based on the needs and growth of the project, but the governing body will always be committed to openness, diversity and the principle that technical decisions are made by technical contributors.

**Any individual may hold multiple roles simultaneously such as being a Maintainer and a member of the TC.**
