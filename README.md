#  Magma website

This is the Magma open source project website.

## Overview

It's based on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org).

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Prerequisites

- Node (v8.2.0 or higher)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli)
- [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)

## Setup

Install yarn on your system: [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Deploy to Netlify (option A)

Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of the repository:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jbryce/magma-website&amp;stack=cms"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

After clicking that button, you’ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from this repository. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete. Next, you’ll need to set up Netlify’s Identity service to authorize users to log in to the CMS.

### Access Locally

Pulldown a local copy of the Github repository Netlify created for you, with the name you specified in the previous step
```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

This uses [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev) CLI feature to serve any functions you have in the `lambda` folder.

To test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:

```
$ npm run build
$ netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

## Install locally (option B)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenStackweb/osf-website-template
$ yarn 
```
